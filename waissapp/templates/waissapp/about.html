                    <p>Part of Project SARAI&apos;s advocacy is the practice of smart irrigation &ndash; the application of irrigation at the right time at the right amount. The project has developed two systems for soil water monitoring and management: the Water Advisory for Irrigation Scheduling System (WAISS) and the WAISS &ndash; Evapotranspiration-based Irrigation Scheduler and Calculator (WAISS-ETCal).</p>

The field unit is installed in the farm for daily moisture content measurement.&nbsp;The server, consisting of a GSM module and software, receives the data from the field unit and analyzes it to generate irrigation advisories. The advisories are then sent to end-users via SMS, daily and during critical periods. End-users may opt to request the current status of their farm by texting &ldquo;STATUS&rdquo; to the WAISS server.​</p>

The calibrated reference evapotranspiration reading can be used to estimate the amount of water to irrigate the crop by computing the actual evapotranspiration.​</p>

I​n this application, the user can create their account based on the characteristics of their farm, such as crop planted and soil texture, and the availability of an atmometer or nearby weather station where evapotranspiration measurements will be computed from. Daily irrigation advisories and schedules are generated through this application, which stakeholders can refer to when scheduling their farm activities.</p>
